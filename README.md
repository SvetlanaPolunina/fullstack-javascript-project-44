# Brain-games @hexlet/code

"Brain games" is a set of five console-based games designed similarly to popular brain-training mobile apps. Each game presents questions that require correct answers. After three correct answers, the game is considered completed. Incorrect answers end the game and prompt the player to try again.

Games:
* Calculator. Solve arithmetic expressions.

* Progression. Find the missing numbers in a sequence.

* Even or Odd. Determine if a number is even.

* Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). Find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

* Prime Number. Check if a number is prime.
